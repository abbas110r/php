Projects made by using php
    PROJECT 1 - form.php
          a simple sign up form having the following fields
          1.FirstName
          2.LastName
          3.Email
          4.PhoneNumber
          5.Password
          I have used two front-end frameworks to design the form materializecss to design the outlook and bootstrap was mandatory to use because materializecss            doesnt have 
          an alert class so i sticked to bootstrap.
