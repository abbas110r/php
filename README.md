# php
Projects made by using php
a simple sign up form having the following fields
1.FirstName
2.LastName
3.Email
4.PhoneNumber
5.Password
I have used two front-end frameworks to design the form materializecss to design the outlook and bootstrap was mandatory to use because materializecss doesnt have 
an alert class so i sticked to bootstrap.
